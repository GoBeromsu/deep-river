# Summary
Machine learning algorithms have become indispensable in today's world. 
They support and accelerate the way we make decisions based on the data at hand. 
This acceleration means that data structures that were valid at one moment could no longer be valid in the future. 
With these changing data structures, it is necessary to adapt machine learning (ML) systems incrementally to the new data. 
This is done with the use of online learning or continuous ML technologies. 
While deep learning technologies have shown exceptional performance on predefined datasets, they have not been widely applied to online, streaming, and continuous learning.
`Deep-River` is a python package for deep learning on data streams. 
It is built on top of `river` and `PyTorch` and provides a unified API for both supervised and unsupervised learning. 
It also provides a set of tools for data stream preprocessing and evaluation of deep learning models.
